Description: An implementation for the 'LUCID' method to jointly estimate latent unknown clusters/subgroups with integrated data. 
  An EM algorithm is used to obtain the latent cluster assignment and model parameter estimates. 
  Feature selection is achieved by applying the regularization method.
