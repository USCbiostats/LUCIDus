Description: An implementation of the LUCID model (Peng (2019) <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btz667>).
  LUCID conducts integrated clustering using exposures, omics data (and outcome 
  as an option). An EM algorithm is implemented to estimate MLE of the LUCID model.
  LUCIDus features integrated variable selection, incorporation of missing omics
  data, bootstrap inference, prediction and visualization of the model.
